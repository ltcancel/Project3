As a Data Scientist you’ll be a core member of our Fast Forward Labs Application Development team. This is a client facing position. You will spend most of your time building machine learning models to tackle real life business problems through asking the right questions, understanding proprietary and publicly available data, extracting and leveraging insights from the data, and communicating both process and outcome to business stakeholders.
Skills and Qualifications:
This position requires a strong math background, with a particular focus on machine learning algorithms and comfort with quantitative analysis.

You should be quite familiar with leading practices in the machine learning lifecycle, including data preparation for analysis, ML model selection, training and validation. We also expect that you have experience with preparing ML models for production.

We expect you to be a strong programmer, and willing to embrace software engineering best practices. We primarily work in Python for research code but are always open to the best technologies for a given problem.

You should also have a background in current CI/CD and DevOps practices. Working knowledge of the Kubernetes ecosystem and production-grade ML systems is a plus.

You should be comfortable to diving into diverse forms of data in order to help define questions that can and should be answered

We often find in applied machine learning that the art of asking the right question is more of a challenge than finding the answer. We expect you’ll be enthusiastic and skilled at formulating the right questions and thinking strategically. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best answer.

You should have spent at least 3 years as a practicing data scientist or machine learning engineer.

In your past, you should have completed a degree program in a computationally intensive quantitative field (e.g. CS, physics, neuroscience, operations management, operations research) or demonstrated relevant experience in using data science and machine learning to solve business problems.

We expect that you have extensive experience using python (+ pandas) for statistical analysis and machine learning.

We would also love to learn about your experiences working with supervised (e.g. regression, classification) and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

At Fast Forward Labs, we believe that you should do what you love most of the time. As such, you should have a keen interest in ability to creatively combine algorithms to solve novel problems. In addition it should excite you to explain nuanced technical work to business stakeholders in plain language, and to create effective data visualizations. Of course, it’s important that you enjoy working with business stakeholders, data engineers, product engineers, model deployment teams.

Because this is a development-focused role, you should have familiarity with production ready code, testing frameworks, and collaborative coding environments (e.g. git).

Who We Are

Cloudera Fast Forward Labs is an applied machine learning research group within Cloudera that helps organizations recognize and develop new product and business opportunities through emerging machine learning and AI technologies. We offer a research subscription service, consulting services and advisory services to companies in a wide set of industries.

We support our clients by helping them create powerful data products, help businesses capture the value of emerging data capabilities, and bring the lessons learned through that work to our research process.

We value thoughtfulness, curiosity, creativity, and diverse perspectives. This position is based in our Brooklyn office."

Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.We accomplish this by leveraging domain experts to create semantically rich training data on the order of less than 1% of the data from which our models continuously learn. As a result, we are able to produce a non-linear return on the cognitive effort expended by domain experts. Our dynamic continuously learning models, activated by proprietary mathematical functions, underlie an AI platform with a variety of core capabilities including intelligent web crawling, contextual analytics and semantic search. Leveraging these core capabilities, we build smart analytical tools that continuously read, understand and learn in specialized ways. As our smart analytical tools learn, they extract hidden features buried in complexity that surface predictive insights that would be impossible to find using traditional intelligence and tools.Our products are helping customers generate alpha by identifying and ranking sources most likely to publish reliable, market moving M&A rumors; monitor important shifts in topical nuance based on the interplay between management commentary and analyst questions in earnings transcripts; and monitor patient chatter on the efficacy and safety of clinical drug trials.Based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.If you’re the right person for the job, we look forward to hearing from you!Job Type: Full-timeEducation:Doctorate (Required)Work Location:One locationBenefits offered:Paid time offHealth insuranceDental insuranceHealthcare spending or reimbursement accounts such as HSAs or FSAsOther types of insuranceRetirement benefits or accountsGym memberships or discountsCommuting/travel assistanceFlexible schedules"

For the 28th year, MSK has been named a top hospital for cancer by U.S. News & World Report. We are proud to be on Becker’s Healthcare list as one of the 150 Great Places to Work in Healthcare in 2018, as well as one of Glassdoor’s Employees’ Choice Best Place to Work for 2018. We’re treating cancer, one patient at a time. Join us and make a difference every day.

Job Description
WHEN APPLYING: Please include (as a single PDF) both a resume and a cover letter; in the letter, we’d love to hear about the most impactful project you’ve worked on recently.

Strategy Analytics and Patient Access

The Strategy Analytics team (within the Department of Strategy & Innovation) leverages data to shape strategic decisions at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and solve problems that measurably impact the lives of our patients and staff. We were awarded the 2012 INFORMS Prize for “repeatedly applying the principles of advanced analytics and operations research / management science in pioneering, varied, novel, and lasting ways.” We encourage analysts’ technical and business skill development in a variety of ways, including conferences and external workshops, internal training and journal clubs, creating analytical tools and best practices, and developing our own in-house R package.

This position is part of the Embedded Analytics Program and has dual reporting to (1) the Senior Director of Patient Access for goal setting and project implementation and (2) the Analytics Manager for technical supervision and mentorship. Embedded Analytics allows our analysts to be a full member of an operational team to truly understand their needs and ensure sustainable implementation of work, while still being part of a diverse and energizing community of analytics experts.

The Patient Access Service (PAS) is the front-door for the majority of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s patients. A team of 70+ Care Advisors and nurses is charged with helping patients access MSK clinicians by collecting information about their medical history and treatments, identifying the right sub-specialist to provide expert care, and coordinating appointment logistics.

The Role and Projects

We are seeking a Senior Strategic Consultant / Data Scientist who will serve as the lead on projects crucial to ensuring MSK’s growth and allowing patients continued access to our clinicians’ expertise. This will involve defining and scoping analyses, collecting and managing data, performing statistical and mathematical modeling, developing new tools and systems, and disseminating actionable insights. This will be as part of a team of two, in partnership with the current Data Scientist embedded with the Patient Access Service.
You will:
Serve as an analytical thought partner to Patient Access leadership, especially the Senior Director, Clinical Director, and 8 front-line managers
Become deeply versed in the operational needs of Patient Access and own the strategic roadmap for iteratively developing analytical products in support of those needs
Manage individual analytical products and projects (both independently and in collaboration with the current Data Scientist) from ""question to answer"" including problem framing, data collection and validation, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, visualization, synthesis, and ongoing maintenance of reusable tools
Effectively communicate actionable insights and see them through to implementation
Sample projects include:Growth Planning and Strategy: PAS leadership collaborates closely with clinicians and administrators on how to grow and manage their services. How can we provide them additional data and insights to guide clinician recruitment and practice management?
Call Center Operations: Patient demand is variable and changing. How can we define optimal staffing and training policies so as to maximize service levels while maintaining staff satisfaction?
Patient Experience: How can we collect timely and relevant data about patients’ experience of becoming an MSK patient while being respectful of their time and emotional state? How can we surface insights from this data to improve PAS operations?

Qualifications

We are looking for an analytics professional who has both deep technical skills and a passion for applying them to real-world problems in partnership with non-technical stakeholders. Our successful analysts typically have the below qualifications:

You have a proven track record (4-7 years of experience) of using analytics and data science to impact key business decisions
You’re a strong consultant skilled at partnering with non-technical stakeholders to turn vague business problems into crisp analytical projects
You know how to choose the right technical approach for a question (from a statistical model to a dashboard and everything in between) and know that the simplest solution is often the best
You’re a storyteller, able to synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources and clearly communicate complex topics to non-technical audiences

You’ve conducted reproducible analyses using R, Python, or a similar language
You’ve built beautiful production-grade dashboards using Tableau or a similar BI tool
You’re deeply comfortable with relational databases and SQL
You have a solid understanding of common statistical methods (especially regression models and probability)

You’re curious and self-motivated, and you thrive when working autonomously. You know when to run with something and when to ask for help.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g. statistics, economics, operations research, mathematics) or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience

Nice-to-have qualifications (but definitely not requirements) would include a master’s degree and prior experience in healthcare consulting or call center operations.

As one of the most exciting and unique candidates in the Democratic presidential race, entrepreneur Andrew Yang sets out to bridge the divide in American society. In 2011, he founded Venture for America, an entrepreneurial non-profit that helped create 2,500 jobs in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh.

Once Andrew realized that new technology, such as artificial intelligence, threatened to eliminate one-third of all American jobs, he knew he had to do something. In The War on Normal People (2018), he explains the mounting crisis and makes the case for implementing a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult: no strings attached. Most importantly, Andrew Yang understands that the future of America is not left, not right, but forward.

To learn more about the campaign, go to Yang2020.com.
You can also hear more from Andrew on the Joe Rogan Experience!

Every campaign claims to be data driven. After working for us, you'll realize everyone else is just fooling themselves.

The data team needs top tier analytic talent to answer the big questions of the campaign. The campaign turns to us when they want to know where to buy ads, where to direct field efforts, where to host big events, how to raise money, or where we're getting enough delegates to win.
Required:
Experience pulling data from relational databases
Experience doing reporting and data visualization
Analysis and model building skills
Insight into what the data can show us, strategically and politically
Deep alignment with the Yang2020 platform
Bonus Points for:

Time Series Analysis
Supervised Learning (GBM's, Neural Networks)

Working for the data team is a chance to use your craft to make a major impact on Yang2020 and the world. You are not going to find a campaign that is more receptive to data-based feedback.

We would prefer to hire people in NY or who can relocate, but we're open to remote work for the right candidate.
